## Project Aim -  

To create a platform which helps to grow network between students and seniors(both present and graduated) to get better career opportunities.  

---

## Why ?  

we feel that final year students and alumini network can be extremly helpful in getting internship, referral into companies.  

## What do most of other such platforms lack ?   

- Since this is inter-college network, so we expect high response rate than traditional platforms.  
- Also users which get job/internship using this platform, will also help other and this will create chain reaction and boost the use of this platform.   
- Since we only have users from our college thus limited users, and this acts as a positive influence, only connecting users to poeple who have high response rate.
- We will also have rejection list.  
- This is a free service, no one has to pay for it, ever.
- Interview exp. will be tagged along with user profile.
